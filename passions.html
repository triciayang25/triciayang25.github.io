                <h4>Gouache</h4>
                <p>I describe this art medium as a mix of watercolor and acrylic paints. I'm waiting for a time to sit down and be able to try out my gouache paints. Hopefully this winter break I will be able to do so!
                </p>

                <h4>Drawing</h4>
                <p>I've done both traditional and digital drawing. I usually use Procreate for digital and often catch myself double tapping my paper only to realize... it's paper.
                </p>

                <h4>Wire Jewelry</h4>
                <p>I also make wire jewelry which is the typical jewelry you think of but no sautering (in my case) and just bending wire until it looks pretty.

            <div id="text">
                <h4>Taiwanese</h4>
                <p>The most comfort food is my mom's cooking but I like to think she drew inspiration from Taiwanese/Chinese cuisine when immigrating to the US in the 1990s. My A-ma's (grandmother's) cooking is one of the most special flavors in the world, though.
                </p>

                <h4>Japanese</h4>
                <p>With extended family in Japan, I greatly enjoy my travels and visits to the beautiful country with some of the most delicious and eye-catching meals I've ever had.
                </p>

                <h4>Anything!</h4>
                <p>I'm a big eater and not picky so I enjoy trying new foods and learning about the story, history, or culture behind each dish.
